# AI Agent Development Framework

This framework provides a structured instruction system for AI coding agents.

Instead of relying on free-form prompts, the system defines:

- agent governance
- instruction hierarchy
- architecture awareness
- development workflows
- validation and measurement
- failure handling and recovery
- continuous optimization

The goal is to convert LLMs from conversational tools into structured development assistants that follow engineering discipline and produce reliable, repeatable outputs.

## Framework Model

This framework operates as a **closed-loop system**:

```plaintext
Route -> Resolve -> Execute -> Validate -> Measure -> Improve -> Recover
```

Each stage is enforced through dedicated system components.

## Framework Layers

### 1. Governance Layer

Defines system boundaries, behavior, and authority.

- `guardrails.md`
- `instruction_priority.md`
- `model_instructions.md`
- `system_contract.md`

### 2. Input & Context Layer

Determines what the system should do and what information is relevant.

- `task_router.md`
- `context_resolver.md`
- `state_manager.md`

### 3. Execution Layer

Controls how tasks are performed.

- `workflow_engine.md`
- `task_template.md`
- `change_planning.md`

### 4. Validation Layer

Ensures correctness and completeness.

- `validation_agent.md`
- `metrics.md`

### 5. Recovery Layer

Handles failures and ensures system resilience.

- `failure_handler.md`
- `debugging_playbook.md`

### 6. Optimization Layer

Improves system performance over time.

- `prompt_optimizer.md`

### 7. Engineering Standards Layer

Ensures code quality and maintainability.

- `code_style.md`
- `anti_overengineering.md`

## System Behavior

The system operates under the following guarantees:

- all tasks are routed before execution
- context is resolved before decisions are made
- execution follows a defined workflow
- outputs are validated before delivery
- performance is measured
- failures are classified and corrected
- prompts and workflows improve over time

## Key Properties

This framework enables:

### Deterministic Execution

Tasks follow consistent workflows instead of ad-hoc reasoning.

### Context Awareness

The system resolves conflicting inputs and prioritizes relevant information.

### Reliability

Outputs are validated and measured before being accepted.

### Adaptability

Failures and metrics drive continuous improvement.

### Scalability

Modular agents and layered architecture support system growth.

## Role of the Agent

The agent operates as a structured development assistant, not a free-form generator.

It must:

- follow defined workflows
- respect instruction hierarchy
- produce minimal, correct changes
- avoid unnecessary complexity

Human developers remain responsible for:

- architecture decisions
- final validation
- system evolution

## Final Principle

This framework is not a prompt system.

It is a controlled AI development environment.

Reliability, clarity, and correctness take priority over creativity or speed.
